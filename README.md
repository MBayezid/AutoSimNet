# AutoSimNet: Visually Similar Product Recommendations

This repository contains the implementation of AutoSimNet, a system designed to provide visually similar product recommendations. It leverages the power of autoencoders to learn meaningful embeddings from product images and utilizes nearest neighbor algorithms to identify visually similar items.

**Key Features:**

*   **Image Embedding Generation:** Employs an autoencoder to generate compact and informative embeddings from product images.
*   **Visual Similarity Search:** Uses distance measures on the generated embeddings to quantify visual similarity between products.
*   **K-Nearest Neighbors Recommendation:** Implements KNN (or approximate nearest neighbors) to find the top-K visually similar products for a given query product.

This project aims to explore and demonstrate an effective approach for building visually-driven product recommendation systems. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to its development, or adapt it for your own applications.
